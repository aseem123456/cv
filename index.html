<p><em> Graduate student in University of New Mexico </em></p>


<p>I am mechanical engineer and also an electrical engineer. i love to learn new things and these days i am making a
    habit
    of learning to code as this looks interesting and all
    we need is a computer and no other sophisticated machines so we can learn in our own home and don't have to depend on
    any
    other machine of course apart from your one and only machine computer.
    Apart of coding i also love to play chess and guitar.<br> I love to meditate too.</p> </td>
